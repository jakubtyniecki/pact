# Python Algorithms Collection

Project *PACT* is a part of my personal RnD program aiming to learn & discover new things around programming. Here in particular python language with corresponding technologies and frameworks.

As a target for this app i've chosen different algorithms and data structures that i've learned in the past and those that i'm learning currently. Starting from a set of sorting routines with related metrics for complexity comparison and plots to visualize differences between them on the ground of different data and possible optimizations.

Current development stage is just a start and will be regularly updated with implementations of new algorithms and related data structues, new and/or improved metrics and visualization techniques followed by integrations with tools and frameworks that would enhance it.

## Roadmap

1. Sorting
  * Insert
  * Shell
  * Heap
  * Merge (rec + iter)
  * Quick (rec + iter)
  * Hybrid (Quick/Insert rec + iter)
2. Searching
  * Binary
3. Trees
  * BST
  * AWL
  * Red-Black
4. Graphs
  * BFS
  * DFS
  * Dijkstra
